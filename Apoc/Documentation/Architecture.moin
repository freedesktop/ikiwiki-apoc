== SPI: Service Provider Interface ==
The SPI (Service Provider Interface) defines an abstraction layer between the core APOC components, such as the Desktop Agent and the Desktop Manager, and a plugable configuration backend. It allows to navigate and search for entities (organizations, users, roles, domains and hosts) within a given organization structure. Second, it provides an interface for assigning, retrieving and editing of configuration data (profiles) for the various entities. Third, it provides an implementation for merging the different profiles into a resulting configuration setting for a specific host/user combination.

The SPI is able to talk with almost any LDAPv3 server, and also, it's able to store the configuration data in a file based repository, which is designed mostly for testing purposes.

== The Desktop Agent, the Policy API and the Adapters ==
The Desktop Agent is a daemon that runs on the client side, its responsible of retrieving the configuration data from the repository using the SPI.

In order to integrate the configuration backend of each application with the desktop agent, an adapter is needed, adapters are small pieces of code that listen to configuration requests on the application side and ask the Desktop Agent for applicable configuration keys on request.

This library wraps a communication interface against the desktop agent, that goes through an XML stream following a request-response query. ||

== Desktop Manager ==

The Desktop Manager is the web user interface for APOC, it allows to create and deploy configuration profiles into the organization entities such as users, groups, roles and hosts. It uses the SPI to access and store data into the configuration repositories. It's a Java based web interface built on top of the [http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-1985/6mhm8o5kj?a=view Java Web Console],
