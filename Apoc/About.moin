= About APOC =

The APOC project is based on the Sun Desktop Manager product which was originally developed by the Sun Microsystems' Sun Ray team in an effort to provide a centralised management capability for Sun Java Desktop System. In late 2007 Sun decided to sponsor APOC as an open source project on freedesktop.org with a view to building a community around this software and extending the use of APOC to additional operating systems and applications. Sun has released the apoc code using a [http://apoc.freedesktop.org/license/cddl.html CDDL] license.
